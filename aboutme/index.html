            Hello, I'm Efe Enahoro, but you can call me Efe. I'm a Nigerian residing in Lagos with
            my wonderful wife. Our joy comes from our two amazing daughters who constantly make us proud.
            My profession is farming, and my faith is rooted in Christianity. I have a strong passion for exploring new horizons.

            Recently, I took the initiative to enroll in a programming course at BYU Idaho, and I'm fervently praying for God's 
            guidance throughout this educational journey. I'm genuinely excited about the prospects this opportunity brings,
            not only for my personal growth but also for the betterment of my family's future.
            I am a friend of LDS. <em>Thanks guys</em>
